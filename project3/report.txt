4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Generating the Waltz)
      Approach: Set the minuet 2D lists with 11 * 16 matrix.
      Accept the first 11 * 16 elements from the data/mozart.txt file.
      Set the two dice for the sum of two random numbers.
      The range of the dice is [0,5] because list elements start with 0 instead of 1.
      Set for loop making the random 16 minuet measures.
      Write to standard output a random sequence of 16 minuet measures.

      Set the 2D lists with 6 * 16 matrix.
      Accept the last 6 * 16 elements from the data/mozart.txt file.
      Set one die for the random numbers.
      The range of the dice is [0,5] because list elements start with 0 instead of 1.
      Set for loop making the random 16 trio measures.
      Write to standard output a random sequence of 16 trio measures.
      Finally, after writting total of 32 outputs, finish the output.

      Issues and resolution:
      I was confused with storing the minuet and trio elements from the text file.
      However, Moiz, the SI, helped me understand
      how stdio.readInt() does not read elements that were already accepted before.
      For creating the random 16 measures, I thought I had to use stdrandom.uniformInt().
      But, by using for loop, I can easily create the measures.
      When I was working on the stander outputs, I did not know how to end the output.
      I solved it by simply writting stdio.writeln().

      Finally, this was the major problem. I checked every typo, loops, and ranges
      before I ran the code on Pycharm. However, it was giving the same errors again and again.

      python generatewaltz.py < data/mozart.txt

At line:1 char:26
+ python3 generatewaltz.py < data/mozart.txt
+                          ~
The '<' operator is reserved for future use.
    + CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : RedirectionNotSupported

       It came out I can do this when I directly use CMD instead of using PyCharm.
       I was so confused because the Gradescope even said my code is correct.
       I checked the terminal in PyCharm; it was through PowerShell and cmd.
       I tried both of them, but it did not work.
       My pc use Window.

   Problem 2 (Playing the Waltz)
      Approach: Accept all the elements by making a new play list.
      Set the conditions: if the number of measures is not 32, exit with the message,
      if a minuet measure is not from [1, 176], exit with the message, and
      if a trio measure is not from [1, 96], exit with the message.
      Finally, play the first 16 minuet music and the last 16 trio music
      with for loop and if statement.

      Issues and resolution: I had to think a lot about how I can write data/M"minuet numnber".
      However, I realized that I can just make data/M as a letters
      and the munuet number as a variable.
      Another issue was that I caanot play the music.
      Therefore, I posted on Piazza, and one of instructors
      said they will check it manually.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I feel much more ccomfortable using lists now. As I write codes,
   I realize that understanding what I wrote is so important.
