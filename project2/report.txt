3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   Aayush Shrivastava  TA          indent problems, the range for the while loops
   MuhammadMoiz Amjad  SI          fixing errors when I input a value.
                                    Mostly, it was because the indent of loops.
                                   For card.py, I asked the general idea of what I should do.
                                   For gcd.py, he showed how to write p and q with p mod q.
   ...                ...          ...

4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Wind Chill)
      Approach: since it was similar problem that was in project 1, I put the general coding.
      However, because it requires the range for the temperature and the speed,
      I used if statement.

      Issues and resolution: The problem was straight forward.
      But, I had to make the indent lines are correctly placed

   Problem 2 (Day of the Week)
      Approach: Again, because it was on the project 1, it was easy set up.
      In addition, because it requires us to translate the numbers to names,
      I had to state the names. By using if statement, I stated the name of the days.

      Issues and resolution: None.

   Problem 3 (Playing Card)
      Approach: Usingg if statements so that the suits and ranks can be redfined
      as what the standard output look like

      Issues and resolution: Because it is such a simple problem,
      I felt as if there are shorter way to write the coding.
      However, it came out I had to write the whole if statements
      so that the ranks and suits will come out as output.

   Problem 4 (Root Finding)
      Approach: set the inputs and t. Using while loop so that it repeats.
      Finally, write down calculation.

      Issues and resolution: None.

   Problem 5 (Greatest Common Divisor)
      Approach: Set the arguments. Use While for repeat and write down the exchanging values.

      Issues and resolution: because I did not know how to write
      "Exchange p and q with q and p mod q." I was struggling for 40 mins.
      However, the SI helped me to write it down saying I can use comma for this.

   Problem 6 (Fibonacci Number)
      Approach: accecpting the arguments and setting the original value for a and i.
      using while loop for repeating.

      Issues and resolution: I had the same issue as problem 5.
       However, by the help of SI, I solved it.

   Problem 7 (Sum of Powers)
      Approach: accepting the arguments. Set the total as 0. Using for loop
      so that I can set the range. Increment total by i**k

      Issues and resolution: None.

   Problem 8 (Dragon Curve)
      Approach: accept the argument. Set dragon and nogard to the string “F”.
      Using for loop setting the range. Finally, exchanging the dragon or nogard with L or R.

      Issues and resolution: None.

   Problem 9 (Perfect Numbers)
      Approach: accept n as argument. Set total to 0. Using for loop setting the range.
      If i mod j = 0, increment total by j. If total = i, write i (perfect number).


      Issues and resolution: None

   Problem 10 (Ramanujan Numbers)
      Approach: set the argument. Before writing the while loop,
      set a = 1 so that a has a place to start with. Because we set the value of a,
      next loops are going to be b = a + 1, c = a + 1, and d = c + 1.
      Finally, when while loops are satisfied,
      use if statement so that it can calculate the number.
      For the times, when the while loops are not satisfied, increment each value by 1.

      Issues and resolution: The main problem I faced was indenting the loops.
      One of TA just deleted one indent lines
      and solved the whole problem. In addition, I tried to set a value as a name.
      The coding could not identify the name as the value.
      Therefore, I just wrote down the value by putting actual calculation.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   As I learn more about writing codings, I feel so satisfied with taking cs110 class.
   Although I face some difficulties, I love the process of thinkging and analyzing problems.
   Specifically, my mathematical brain is helping me a lot.
